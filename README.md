# odin-mastermind
A simple mastermind command line game built with Ruby. 


The player can choose whether to be code-maker or code-breaker. 


As code-maker, the player selects the value for four positions out of six options. The computer then guesses the positioning, saving the result each time it is correct. The computer has 12 rounds to assemble the correct four values and their positions.


As code-breaker, the computer randomly generates the four positions and the user guesses each position's value. After each guess, the user is informed whether their guessed color is present within the code, and if so, whether they have placed it at the correct position. The user has 12 rounds to assemble the correct four values and their positions.
